# WARNING: COST, RATE LIMITING, AND PRIVACY NOTICE
# ==============================================================================
# Using AI models via vibe-tools can incur costs depending on the provider,
# model, and your account type (e.g., Free Tier vs. Paid Tier).
#
# Automated execution of this script (e.g., via cron) can lead to unexpected
# charges. Always review the pricing for your chosen model and provider. Many
# providers also have rate limits; the `SLEEP_DURATION` setting helps
# mitigate this, but you may need to adjust it based on your usage.
#
# For Google Gemini models, refer to the official pricing page:
# https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing
#
# Also, be aware of the data privacy policies associated with the AI provider,
# as the content of your code diffs will be sent to their servers for analysis.
